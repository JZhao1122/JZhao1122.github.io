# About Me
Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I`m **Jian Zhao (J.Zhao, èµµä¿­)**. 


I am pursuing a dual bachelor's degree in Internet of Things Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/" style="color: #000090;">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)<a> and <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" style="color: #000090;">Queen Mary University of London<a>. Currently interning at <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/" style="color: #000090;">Shanghai AI Laboratory<a> under the supervision of <a href="https://biqing-qi.github.io/" style="color: #000090;">Prof. Biqing Qi</a>, leading research projects on compute-optimal scaling of LLMs. Additionally directing a **Beijing Natural Science Foundation-funded project** on 3D point cloud segmentation. My recent work was featured as **HuggingFace Daily Papers Top 1** and covered by **QbitAI/AI Era**.
